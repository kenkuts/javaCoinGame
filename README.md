# javaCoinGame
/*This game is meant for two or more players. In this game, the players take turns flipping a coin. Before the coin is flipped, players should guess if the coin will land heads up or tails up. If a player guesses correctly, then that player is awarded a point. If a player guesses incorrectly, then that player will lose a point. The first player to score five points is the winner.
Write a program that simulates the game being played by two players. Use the Coin class that you wrote as an assignment in Chapter 5 to simulate the coin. Write a Player class to simulate the players.
I have the coin class already written, but am confused about how to write the Player class. Any help you can provide would be appreciated*/
